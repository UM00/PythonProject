# PythonProject
 This is the Project in which we were required to train the bot and let it fight against the CPU on its own
 we extracted the data set by playing the game ourselves and then we used that data to apply the model and train it
Here we Have applied the Machine Learning and in model.py File there is complete model applied which Trains and Test the Data
Then in Bot.py we integrated the model into the game
